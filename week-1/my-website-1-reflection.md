Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

How to create a repository on GitHub:

Creating a repository on GitHub is a lot like creating a new Word document. You have to log in to GitHub and simply click the "Add repository" button under the + sign on your screen (much like just clicking "File > new" in Word). You can customize the file slightly by adding a license or description, or making your repository public (like picking a new font or format for your Word document).

Cloning a repository is sort of like downloading a file from the internet to your computer. Once you find the repository you'd like to clone, you have to copy the URL. Then, in terminal on your computer, you navigate to the location where you want the repository to live, and write out a simple git command to transfer the repository to your computer. This parallels downloading a file: you simply click the download link and then decide where you want the file to live on your computer.

Describe what open source means.

Open source means that anyone can edit or review your code. To me, that means collaboration and sharing of software among the entire (coding) world. If someone uses your code and wants to sell it, he/she cannot do so informing the purchaser that the code is free.

What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

I think I feel ambivalent (but that may change!). I like that anyone can help anyone with their code. I also like the ideal of all code being free, but I do understand why companies want to keep their code private.

Assess the importance of using licenses.

I think it's important to use licenses because every time you submit public code, you want to be sure that it is treated the way you want it to be. If you don't include a license with your code on github, anyone could take your code and sell it.

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

Every concept was pretty solidified for me in this challenge because I had to repeat it several times. I had to delete and re-add my "phase-0" repo on GitHub because I accidentally edited the master (at least I think that's what happened). I had an "aha" moment when I realized that using "git pull origin master" didn't work on my computer, for whatever reason. That caused me a lot of grief because after I got an error when "pull origin master" that, I tried "git branch" and got another error. I redid everything after getting that message instead of just quitting terminal and restarting it (which I now know I can do).

I struggled with all of the steps required for pulling requests. I think after doing it a few times, I am getting the hang of it. But, I know that I will probably have to review Emmanuel's videos again.

Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I just used what was given to me. The videos were the most helpful to me!
