Reflections

# 1.1 Think About Time Reflection

Which time management and productivity ideas did you learn about?
I spent the most time on the tiny habits videos/articles. I liked the Fogg Method's point about existing triggers as the necessary steps before a changed habit. I also liked the timeboxing/Pomodoro techniques. I think that burnout is real throughout the day, and scheduling time off is a great way to prevent that.

What is "Time Boxing?" How can you use it in Phase 0?
Time Boxing is the concept of only allocating a certain amount of time for a specific task and then reflecting. I think this can be used in the weekly assignments, by spending 25 minutes on a task and then reflecting to see what I've learned. It could also be productive for pair programming, so that my pair and I can take a few minutes to step back and make sure we're on track.

How do you manage your time currently?
I currently try to manage my time by scheduling certain times to perform certain tasks. I also use to-do lists and my calendar so that I don't forget important dates.

Is your current strategy working? If not, why not?
It's working OK right now. I haven't been very effective with it right now for one main reason: 1. At work, I'm not extremely motivated because I know I will quit my job soon and I know that the work I have to do is not that hard. 2. In my personal life, I'm also not super motivated because I don't have any pressing issues right now. I am generally a procrastinator, so until I feel that I must do something, I won't.

Can/will you employ any of them? If so, how?
I'm definitely going to try to use tiny habits, since I found them the most interesting. I also want to use time boxing/pomodoro so that I don't burn out while studying at home. I think having enough time to reflect and review is important. It's something I used to do most in college. BUT, if I'm ever "on a roll" and in the flow, I will try to keep that up.

What is your overall plan for Phase 0 time management?
I have a few things I'm hoping to do for the best possible Phase 0:

- Read the assignments the first day they come out so that I can immediately ask questions if I don't understand something.

- Immediately write down the due dates in my calendar.

- Set aside two full days each week to do my assignments (I'm part-time at work, so these won't always be the weekend).

- Use pomodoro/time boxing while starting my tasks. If there's a "long" assignment, I may try to set my timer for a little longer than 25 minutes, but I don't know yet.

- Something I've always done: I need to get out of my apartment for assignments. I do not work best at home, so I go to coffee shops or libraries for my best productivity.

# 1.2 The Command Line Reflection

What is a shell? What is "bash?"
Shell: A shell is the program that allows you to interact with the computer’s operating system
Bash: The type of shell we use. It stands for Bourne Again Shell shell (I googled it)

What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?
The most challenging thing was copying files. For some reason, those instructions were unclear for me. I had to research a little further. I also am still wrapping my head around computer commands in general; I've never used the shell before. Also, my typing skills are good, but I'm still not used to typing all of the asterisks and dashes.
Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?
The only commands I had issues with were, again, the copying of files. I successfully used all the others.

In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?
I honestly think all will be important (not to give a "cop out" answer). In thinking about what I will use when programming, I guess the navigating commands will save a lot of time. So, pwd will be important -- it can route you when you’re lost. I also think cd and ../ will be key. Piping information in and out of files could also save a lot of time.

Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.
- pwd  -- print working directory
- ls -- list contents of current directory
- mv -- move something
- cd -- change directory
- ../ -- go up a directory
- touch -- make a file (had to look this one up)
- mkdir -- make a directory
- less -- show contents of a file
- rmdir -- remove directory
- rm -- remove a file
- help -- help with a subject

# 1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection

If you were going to write instructions for a new person on how to create a new repo, fork a repo, and clone a repo, what would they be? Why would you fork a repository as opposed to create a new one?
How to make a new repo:

Sign into GitHub.
Click the plus sign to the left of your name in the top right corner of the page.
Click the option for "New Repository."
Name the repository and select if it should be public/private, have a license, have a gitignore (not sure what this is), have a description, or have a README.
You're all set!
How to fork a repo:

Sign into GitHub.
Go to page of the repo you want to fork.
In the top right-hand corner, below your account photo, choose "fork." This adds the repo to your GitHub.
How to clone a repo:

Sign into GitHub
Once you've forked your desired repo, go to the page of the repo you want to clone.
Look for and copy the HTTPS clone URL on the right-hand side of the page.
Open up your terminal.
Initiate git.
Make sure you're in the file location where you want to store the repo.
Type in: git clone [CLONE URL FROM THE REPO'S GITHUB]
You now have a local copy.
Type the ls command to be sure that all of the files have transferred.
You would fork a repository instead of create a new one if you want to take someone else's repo/project to to review, work on, or learn from. Creating a repo from scratch would be useful for creating your own project (which I don't have yet)!

What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?

Specifically, my biggest struggle was with remembering all of the command codes when I had to delete and re-add the directories. I will not ever again forget that you can't just rmdir on a directory that has files in it. More generally, the many steps for each process of the repo/cloning was kinda tough. But, the video was really great for clarifying what to do.

I learned the difference between git and GitHub (definitely thought they were the same thing for about 2 years). I also learned that the videos are the best way for me to learn. Until I see and hear an actual example described, it can be hard for me to learn.
