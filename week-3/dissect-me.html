    <p>
      If you're confused about git, Github and version control, don't worry: I'm hoping to help explain it to you in this blog post.
    </p>

    <p>
      I only started my Dev Bootcamp program a week ago, so I've only been coding for a week. Be that as it may, I have already learned cool things about the world of "coding."
    </p>

    <p>
      It makes a lot of sense for programmers to use version control. Git is just one type of version control -- just like how Kleenex is actually just one brand of tissue. Version control, more generally, is vital for programmers who want to edit a file simultaneously. By using GitHub, an entire team can submit their changes to a file in an organized way.
    </p>

    <p>
      Version control is key to good programming. Not only does it allow for tracking of code, it also allows for easier collaboration on projects.
    </p>

 <p>
    The benifits of version control can be anything from not messing up your own work, or working with other people on the same project and still keep everything organized. Git helps you keep track of changes by letting you see every time a commit is saved. If you use github to store your changes you can always go back to what you did like a checkpoint that is saved for you online.

What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

  Besides the "main" html tags (html, head, title, and body), I use <p> and <h1>-<h6> most. I think I use them the most because they help create a hierarchy of information. I also think that since they're the most basic, and I understand them best, that I feel most comfortable using them at this point.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

  HTML is not read top-down. Browsers have HTML parsers that go through two phases: tokenization and tree construction. Tokenization takes a "token" (i.e. a tag or attribute) and then it gives it to the tree constructor. It keeps going through all the tokens and keeps giving them to the tree constructor.  The browser reads the html structure, and semantic tags make this easier. Anything nested within a tag is read after its parent. I'm not 100% sure that I'm getting this right.


What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

  Sublime can be customized! While I already figured that it could, I didn't know the extent. It'll be great to have template "snippets" for future projects. I think it will be great to have them for things like making lists; instead of typing out all of the code (ul, li, li...) I could make a list snippet and save some time. I definitely want to take time to learn some shortcuts on Sublime. I know there are many articles on which text editors are best and I hope to search the web for those articles that include tips!
