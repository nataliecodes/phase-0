1.  What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?
  - Information Gathering
    This site calls it the most important step: it sets up everything else. Get all of your information (goals, purpose, demographic) so that you will know how to functionally display these things and accomplish the purpose of your site
  - Planning
    Site map: put together a list of all of the main topics and subtopics your site will have. Organize all of the relevant information into what will be your navigation system. You will also decide which technologies you want to use
  - Design
    Designer creates the look and feel, worrying about the target audience. The designer and you can discuss the prototype/mock-up and communicate what you want changed until you find the best design
  - Development
    First work on the homepage, then the template “shells” for your other pages/sections
    Designer should allow you to see the site as you go
    Testing and Delivery
    Test your site! Make sure that the code is up-to-date and validates
    Upload the web site files to your own server/host
    Make sure your site functions and takes SEO into account
  - Maintenance
    Upkeep of your site – you will want to update your content and other aspects of your site to stay fresh
    You may be able to use a CMS to update your site content, depending on how much the site owner wants to be responsible for

2.  What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

  The primary goal of my website is to let the world wide web know about me, displaying both my work experience and a little bit of my personality. My site will feature text, photos and links.

3.  What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

  My target audience will probably want to know more about me and my work. My site will address this by having sections with the pertinent information -- a "blog" tab for my blog, a "contact" tab to contact me, etc.

4.  What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

  I think that contact will be important. It's conceivable that this will be like an online resume so that those who view it can reach out to me. I will also want users to view my portfolio, because they won't necessarily want to reach out to me, but so that they can get some professional background on me.

5.  What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?

  I think the main issue should be to keep everything high-level. I don't want to force a user to click through too many times to find the information on my site. Another thing will be not including too much text in a content-heavy website. While I can have links to my resume or blog, I want to keep my site clean and simple.

6.  What is user experience design and why is it valuable? 

  User experience design is the concern for how someone will use your website. It's all about getting in the mind of a consumer/user in order to improve your site by testing or working on the pertinent parts.

7.  Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

  I found question 1 a bit tedious -- explaining each step felt repetitive because the name of each step was a bit self-explanatory. But it's good to reinforce good habits and require this type of planning and understanding before putting a plan into action.
