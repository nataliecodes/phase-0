- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

  It's always scary to start with a blank page, so I definitely forgot all of my previous knowledge for the first 10 seconds. But, then it wasn't too bad because sublime autofills html tag information. I had to go back and be sure that I had all of the basics (at first I forgot to include the actual html tag), but then it all made sense.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

  It was surprisingly easy. But, at first I did have to look up what "semantic html" meant. I now know that it means that HTML element names reinforce the meaning of the text/img/section they define. HTML5doctor and the skillcrush cheatsheets covered what I needed to know today. There are some more complicated elements that I haven't delved into that much (my partner and I researched sections and were sort of lost). I am still a little confused about not overusing the div tag, but I think I need to re-read the article listed in Canvas.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

  Because the instructions were clear on not trying to format, I started with the basic elements (h1, p, head, title, ul) and made the site without adding anything else. That way, I wasn't tempted to format/style the page.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?

  I like that the html tags are semantic and align to the meaning of your code. It's also pretty simple; there are only so many tags (I think one of the videos said there are 116), so you can't get too lost. I think that's also one of its constraints - that you can't do too much with it. For an actual website, if you don't have lots of text content, you have to use CSS, Javascript and other styling elements to make your website good and effective.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

  I think you have to practice it, like anything. I also think about it like its original intended use: it's a document editor. So, I think of it like a school essay. There are hierarchies and things you must have: Your name always goes at the top (like a doctype); there are titles/headings (just like titles/headings); then there are paragraphs (like paragraphs) and other references (links, images) you can insert.
